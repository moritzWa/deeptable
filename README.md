## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun (latest version)
- MongoDB
- Stripe account
- Google OAuth credentials
- Doppler CLI

### MongoDB Setup

1. Install MongoDB:

   - **macOS**: `brew install mongodb-community`
   - **Windows**: Download and install from [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
   - **Linux**: Follow distribution-specific instructions from [MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)

2. Start MongoDB:

   - **macOS/Linux**: `mongod --dbpath=/path/to/data/directory`
   - **Windows**: `mongod --dbpath=C:\path\to\data\directory`
   - Or use the MongoDB service if installed

3. Verify MongoDB is running:
   - Connect to MongoDB shell: `mongosh`
   - You should see a connection to localhost:27017

### Database Seeding

The project includes scripts to seed your database with sample data:

1. **Reset Everything**: Delete all data and reseed from scratch
   ```bash
   bun run --cwd server db:reset
   ```

Or run individual commands:

1. **Seed Database**: Creates tables and populates them with sample data

   ```bash
   bun run --cwd server db:seed
   ```

2. **Delete Data**: Removes all data except user accounts
   ```bash
   bun run --cwd server db:delete
   ```

Note: The seeding script uses the email specified in the script to associate data with a user. Make sure to update the email in the script (`server/src/scripts/seeder.ts`) to match an existing user in your database.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moritzWa/deeptable.git

```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables with Doppler

   - Install Doppler CLI if you haven't already
   - Configure your Doppler project
   - No need to manually manage .env files as Doppler will handle this

4. Start the development servers

For the frontend (in the client directory):

```bash
cd client
doppler run -- bun dev --elide-lines=5000
```

For the backend (in the server directory):

```bash
cd server
doppler run -- bun dev --elide-lines=5000
```

## Customization

Search for "GitHire" in the codebase to find all instances that need to be replaced with your own brand name. Key files to check:

- `client/src/components/LandingPage.tsx`
- `client/src/App.tsx`
- `client/src/components/navbar.tsx`
- `client/src/app/blog/posts/index.tsx`
- `server/src/index.ts`

## Deployment

The application is set up as a monorepo with separate client and server packages:

- Frontend: Deploy the `client` directory to a static hosting service
- Backend: Deploy the `server` directory to a Node.js hosting service
